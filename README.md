## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my journey through the web development bootcamp. Each project reflects the skills and knowledge I acquired throughout the course, with a focus on:

- Front-end development with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Back-end development using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
- Building dynamic, interactive websites and APIs.
- Using **Git** for version control and collaboration.
- Understanding web development best practices.

The course covers both theory and practical exercises, ensuring that I gained a well-rounded understanding of how to build modern web applications.

## Technologies Used

Throughout the course, I have worked with the following technologies:

### Front-end:

- **HTML5** – Used for structuring web pages and content.
- **CSS3** – Used for styling web pages, layouts, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core programming language used for interactivity and dynamic content.
- **jQuery** – A JavaScript library for easier DOM manipulation.
- **Bootstrap** – A front-end framework for designing responsive websites.

### Back-end:

- **Node.js** – A JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js** – A web application framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB** – A NoSQL database used for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** – A templating engine for generating HTML markup using JavaScript.

### Tools and Workflow:

- **Git** – For version control and managing project history.
- **GitHub** – Hosting code repositories and collaborating with others.
- **npm** – Node package manager, used to manage dependencies and scripts.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this bootcamp, I have gained the following skills:

- **Web Development Fundamentals:** I learned the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including concepts like the DOM (Document Object Model), event handling, and responsive web design.
- **Server-side Development:** I gained experience with building APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling HTTP requests, and connecting to **MongoDB** for data storage.
- **Full-stack Development:** I built full-stack applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, enabling me to handle both client-side and server-side code effectively.
- **Version Control and Collaboration:** I used **Git** and **GitHub** throughout the course for version control, collaborating with others, and maintaining code history.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging:** I practiced debugging JavaScript code, troubleshooting issues, and improving performance through efficient algorithms and code structure.
