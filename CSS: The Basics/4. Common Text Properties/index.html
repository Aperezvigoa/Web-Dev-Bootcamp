    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the suborder Sepiina. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy. </p>
    <p>Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.[1]</p>
    <p>Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life
        expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most
        intelligent invertebrates.[2] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
        invertebrates.[2]</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>"Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[3] is derived from the Old English name for the species,
        cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[4]</p>
